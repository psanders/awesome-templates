### Built by the community

The open-source community is the ðŸ’— heart of ${organization} and fundamental to how we build software today.

Are you contributing to ${organization}? Yes? Okay, you rock! ðŸŽ¸ If not, we can help you get started! Open-source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### Contributing

You can contribute to the tools ðŸ”§ you rely on from ${organization}. Here is a list of the top projects to contribute to:

- [Repo #1](https://github.com/yourorg/repo1) - The primary repository for ${organization}'s ecosystem
- [Repo #2](https://github.com/yourorg/repo2) - Write here a descritio of your second project
- [Repo #3](https://github.com/yourorg/repo3) - Write here a descritio of your third project

### Become a sponsor

Help us get to our monthly goal. Currently => â–®â–®â–®â–®â–¯ 85%

If you are planning on using ${organization} a monthly contribution would mean a lot. On its own, open-source doesn't pay the bills. Hopefully, continuing our work can be sustainable with your help.
