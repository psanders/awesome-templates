We are building Fonoster in the open. We've been doing this since **October 2020**. Since then we pushed **over 5 thousand commits**, opened **over 130 issues**, submitted roughly **+200 pull requests** across **32 repositories** ðŸ¤¯.

### Built by the community

The open-source community is the ðŸ’— heart of Fonoster and fundamental to how we build software today.

Are you contributing to Fonoster? Yes? Okay, you rock! ðŸŽ¸ If not, we can help you get started! Open-source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).

### Contributing

You can contribute to the tools ðŸ”§ you rely on from Fonoster. Here is a list of the top projects to contribute to:

- [Fonoster](https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster) - The primary repo for Fonoster's ecosystem
- [Routr](https://github.com/fonoster/routr) - The heart of our VoIP Network

### Become a sponsor

Help us get to our monthly goal. Currently => â–®â–®â–®â–®â–¯ 85%

If you are planning on using Fonoster a monthly contribution would mean a lot. On its own, open-source doesn't pay the bills. Hopefully, continuing our work can be sustainable with your help.
